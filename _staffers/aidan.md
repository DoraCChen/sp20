Hey! I'm a first year Biostatistics MA student. I grew up in Lehigh Valley, PA, went to undergrad in Chicago, and worked at an economic consulting firm in Boston for two years before returning to school. In my free time, I like to hike, climb, and go to concerts.  Still figuring out what I want to research while I'm here!  But feel free to ask me about different areas of biostats research going on at Berkeley or UCSF.
