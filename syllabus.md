## Course Format

The course has many opportunities for learning: lecture, section, and tutoring. 

### Lecture

There are 50-minute lectures on M, W, F each week. Lecture slides that are created in R markdown will be available on Datahub in the Lectures folder, ideally at least 12 hours in advance of the lecture, but this is not guaranteed. These will also be distributed in PDF format on the [course schedule](course-schedule). 

Many lectures, including all of Part I of the course, encourage the use of R, RStudio, and Datahub. Please bring your laptop to class if possible, though take steps to minimize distractions (i.e., turning off notifications on your laptops/phones). Specifically, do not use laptops for entertainment and do not display any material on the laptop which may be distracting or offensive to your fellow students. Note this is not a requirement, and some students will prefer to follow along by taking notes on the PDF version of the slides, and reviewing the materials on Datahub after class. 

Webcast will be made available on the [course schedule](course-schedule) soon after lecture. This is an excellent tool for students who would like to review lecture or who miss an occasional lecture. However, this course is not designed as an online course and the course capture should not be considered a substitute for attending the course.  Students should note that the course capture system is not controlled by the instructor, may not capture every lecture, does not always capture the entire lecture, and will most likely not capture all of the audible discussion.  

### Section

The section will be used to explore course concepts, practice R programming skills, review key points from lecture, and provide some practice with exam-type questions. Some sections will also include review of published articles that make use of concepts discussed in class.  

Lab participation will be graded based on submission of the weekly lab by the end of your assigned lab section. **Attendance will not be taken**, but valuable material will be covered and GSIs will provide assistance on the lab during section, so we recommend showing up.‚Äù 

Unless you have a conflict in a particular week and have discussed a switch with your GSI, you must attend the section in which you are registered as the lab rooms are small and cannot accommodate switching.

## Assignments

There will be weekly assignments to help you understand and practice the material, in the form of homework assignments and lab exercises. There will also be one group project.

Assignments will be distributed as R markdown files on Datahub at the dates and times noted in the [course schedule](course-schedule).

### Lab 

Lab exercises are intended to practice concepts from lecture in a practical programming environment. You can complete and submit these during the lab section, or on your own beforehand. Students find it much more helpful to complete this in lab rather than independently, but we understand students learn differently, so feel free to do what works best for you.

Lab exercises are **graded on correct completion**, so you must complete the lab fully, passing all tests, in order to receive credit for the assignment.


### Homework

Homework assignments give you practice performing quantitative analyses in R and interpreting the results. Homework will generally be posted on Wednesday nights and due the following Tuesday night.  

While group work is encouraged, students must submit their own code and completed answers for marking.

### Late Policy  
A 50% late penalty will be applied for any problem set submitted within 24 hours of due date, no marks for assignments submitted thereafter.
