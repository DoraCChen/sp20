# PH 142

This repo hosts the source files for PH142's Spring 2020 [website](https://ph142-ucb.github.io/sp20/).

This site is built from Kevin Lin's [Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class).

### Local development environment

Just the Class is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Just the Docs requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

1. Start your local Jekyll server.
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
1. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
1. Reload your web browser after making a change to preview its effect.
